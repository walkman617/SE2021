# Team Project

---

## Purpose and Method
The purpose of the course project is to provide the students with the knowledge of software engineering methodology and the skills to apply it. The particular project is not the goal in itself; rather, it serves as a vehicle to apply your knowledge and to develop the skills.

## Teamwork and Project Management
Each team consists of **4 to 6 students** working on one of the two projects:
- _**Restaurant Automation**_
- _**Parking Garage/Lot**_

**All team members must take part in all project activities** and none of the activities should be done exclusively by one student. Each team member or a pair must be responsible for all aspects of development required for the features they own, although it is acceptable to seek help from colleagues who are more knowledgeable about particular technical work (e.g., database integration, user interface design, etc.).

**Project management** deals with organizational matters that are needed for effective teamwork. Team members may elect one “team leader” who will take a lead in project coordination activities, or may decide to share coordination responsibilities. 

Most importantly, 
> each team member must be proactive, rather than waiting to be assigned the duties by the team leader or anybody else. 

Remember, 
> all team members are **equally** responsible for **all** aspects of the project.

## Final Report

> Each team must submit a report (**word or pdf**) including product visit link and test method:
- Final Report Template: [Download Here](https://github.com/walkman617/SE2021/blob/main/Template/SE-FinalReport.doc).
- Product Visit Link: Web URL, Mini-Program QR code, App Store Link, or else.
- Product Test Method: Providing test accounts with featured roles to login the product.


> The exact breakdown of individual contributions must be provided for every project deliverable, so that individual grades can be fairly assigned. 

> Negative points will be assigned to reports missing or having an incomplete content.

## Project Grading Policy
Given that this is a design project, it is impossible to define precise grading criteria. 

The grades will inevitably depend on what student teams have to offer—so, **grading is “market-based”**. Those that offer the most-impressive product, receive the highest grade. Which means that, if you receive a grade you are not happy with, it is not necessarily that you did bad work; rather, it is that others did better. Of course, there may be several teams with an impressive product, so several teams may receive the maximum grade.
